# Practical Guide to Git & GitHub Basics

## Introduction to Git and GitHub

1. **What is Git?**  
   Git is a version control system that helps manage changes to files and code. It enables multiple people to work on a project simultaneously, tracks changes, and allows you to revert to previous versions if needed.

2. **What is GitHub?**  
   GitHub is an online platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories. It allows users to share projects, track contributions, and manage collaborative workflows.

3. **Setting Up Git and GitHub**  
   - **Install Git**: Download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
   - **Set up Git username and email** (important for tracking contributions):
     ```bash
     git config --global user.name "Your Name"
     git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
     ```
   - **Create a GitHub account** at [github.com](https://github.com/).

## Use Case: Basic Collaboration Between Two People

### **Starting Setup: Creating and Cloning the Repository**

1. **Create a New Repository on GitHub (Person A)**  
   - *Person A* logs into GitHub, navigates to the main GitHub page, and clicks on **New** or **+ New Repository**.

     ![](assets/0-home-page.png)
   - In the repository creation page:
     - **Repository Name**: Enter a name, e.g., `dummy-repo`.
     - **Description**: Optionally, add a short description.
     - **Visibility**: Choose **Public** or **Private**.
     - Select **Initialize this repository with a README** to create a starter file.
   - Click **Create repository**.

> **Note**: A README is usually the first thing a visitor sees when exploring your repository. It typically provides essential information such as:
> - What the project does
> - Why the project is useful
> - How users can get started with the project
> - Where users can get help
> - Who maintains and contributes to the project

2. **Invite Collaborators (Person A)**
   - After creating the repository, *Person A* goes to **Settings** > **Collaborators and teams**.

     ![](assets/3-settings.png) ![](assets/4-settings-colab.png)
   - Add *Person B’s* GitHub username or email to give them access to the repository.

3. **Accept Invitation (Person B)**
   - *Person B* accepts the invitation to join the repository.

4. **Clone the Repository (Both People)**
   - After receiving access, *Person B* can clone the repository.
   - Both *Person A* and *Person B* copy the SSH or HTTPS link from the repository page and run this command in their terminal:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/username/dummy-repo.git
     ```

     ![](assets/7-clone-repo.png) ![](assets/8-cloning.png)
   - Now, each person has a local copy of the repository. They can open the folder in VS Code.

     ![](assets/9-cloned.png)

   - Check the status with:
     ```bash
     git status
     ```
     ![](assets/10-status-after-cloning.png)

---

### **Step 1: Person A Modifies and Pushes Changes**

1. **Edit a File**  
   - *Person A* opens `README.md` (or any other file) and adds a new line, such as:
     ```plaintext
     # dummy-repo
     
     This is a demo of a basic Git workflow for collaboration.
     ```

     ![](assets/11-modify-readme.png)

2. **Stage the File**  
   - In the terminal, *Person A* stages the modified file to prepare it for committing:
     ```bash
     git add README.md
     ```
     ![](assets/14-staging-changes.png)

3. **Commit the Change**  
   - *Person A* commits the change with a descriptive message:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Add project description to README"
     ```

     ![](assets/16-status-post-commit.png)

4. **Push to GitHub**  
   - *Person A* pushes the change to GitHub:
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```

     ![](assets/17-commit-changes.png)

   - Check the logs:
     ```bash
     git log
     ```

### **Step 2: Person B Pulls the Update and Adds Changes**

1. **Check Status after Person A's Changes**  
   - *Person B* can check the status of their repository to see if it’s up-to-date or if there are any changes pending a pull.

2. **Pull Latest Changes**  
   - *Person B* updates their local repository to include *Person A's* changes by running:
     ```bash
     git pull origin main
     ```
   
     ![](assets/21.jpeg)  
     ![](assets/22.jpeg)

3. **Verify the Changes**  
   - *Person B* opens `README.md` locally to confirm that the new project description from *Person A* is present.

4. **Add New Changes (Person B)**  
   - *Person B* adds a new sample Python file to the project. After adding the file, they can check the status to see the new file as untracked.

     ![](assets/24.jpeg)

5. **Stage Changes**  
   - *Person B* stages the new file to prepare it for committing. They can confirm the status again to ensure the file is staged.

     ![](assets/25.jpeg)

6. **Commit Changes**  
   - *Person B* commits the newly added file with a descriptive message and checks the status to confirm the commit.

     ![](assets/26.jpeg)

7. **Push the Changes to GitHub**  
   - Finally, *Person B* pushes the new commit to the remote repository on GitHub.

## Basic Git Cheat Sheet

### **Basic Commands**

1. **Create a New Repository Locally**
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. **Clone an Existing Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

---

### **Making Changes**

1. **Check Repository Status**  
   Shows any changes in files that are staged, unstaged, or untracked.
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

2. **Stage Changes**  
   Adds specific files to the staging area.
   ```bash
   git add <file>
   ```
   Add all changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

3. **Commit Changes**  
   Records staged changes with a descriptive message.
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```

4. **View Commit History**  
   Lists past commits.
   ```bash
   git log
   ```

---

### **Working with Remote Repositories (e.g., GitHub)**

1. **Push Changes to Remote Repository**  
   ```bash
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```

2. **Pull Changes from Remote Repository**  
   ```bash
   git pull origin <branch-name>
   ```


---

### **Undoing Changes**

1. **Unstage a File**  
   ```bash
   git restore --staged <file>
   ```

2. **Discard Changes in a File**  
   ```bash
   git restore <file>
   ```

3. **Undo the Last Commit**  
   ```bash
   git reset --soft HEAD~1
   ```

4. **Reset to a Previous Commit**  
   Warning: This permanently deletes commits after the specified one.
   ```bash
   git reset --hard <commit-id>
   `

---

### **Summary of Basic Workflow**

1. **Stage** → `git add <file>`
2. **Commit** → `git commit -m "message"`
3. **Push** → `git push origin main`
4. **Pull** → `git pull origin main`
